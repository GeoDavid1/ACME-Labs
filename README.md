These are all the Brigham Young University (BYU) Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACME) Labs that I have completed in the Junior Core and Senior Core.

BYU's ACME major is designed for solving the problems of the 21st century. ACME is an educational model that teaches both the theory and the practical
skills in mathematics, statistics, and computation needed to solve the problems of the modern world.

Feel free to look around.
